That is the sweet, sassy molasses talking.', '{"2 cups all-purpose flour", "2 teaspoons baking soda", "1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon", "1 teaspoon ground ginger", "3/4 teaspoons ground cardamom", "1/2 teaspoons kosher salt", "1 large egg", "1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted", "1/3 cup granulated sugar", "1/3 cup mild-flavored (light) or robust-flavored (dark) molasses", "1/4 cup (packed) dark brown sugar", "Coarse sanding or raw sugar (for rolling)"}', 'Place racks in lower and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 375°F. Whisk flour, baking soda, cinnamon, ginger, cardamom, and salt in a small bowl. Whisk egg, butter, granulated sugar, molasses, and brown sugar in a medium bowl. Mix in dry ingredients just to combine. Place sanding sugar in a shallow bowl. Scoop out dough by the tablespoonful and roll into balls (if dough is sticky, chill 20 minutes). Roll in sugar and place on 2 parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 2 inches apart. Bake cookies, rotating baking sheets halfway through, until cookies are puffed, cracked, and just set around edges (over-baked cookies will not be chewy), 8–10 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let cool. MAKE AHEAD: Cookie dough can be made and rolled into balls 2 weeks ahead. Freeze on a baking sheet; transfer to resealable plastic bags. Let sit at room temperature 30 minutes before rolling in sugar.', 'ALISON ROMAN', 'https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/chewy-molasses-cookies-51205630', '120 min', 'Makes 2 1/2 dozen'),

Parmesan, finely grated (about 1/2 cup)", "1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces, plus more for pan", "3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil", "3/4 cup sage leaves", "1/2 lb. Fontina cheese, cut into 1/2 inch pieces"}', 'Combine 1 Tbsp. salt and 6 cups water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Gradually whisk in polenta, then cook over medium-high heat, whisking constantly, until polenta just begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Stir in squash, reduce heat to medium-low, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until polenta is thick and no longer gritty, and squash mashes easily when pressed with the back of a spoon, 30–40 minutes. Mix in milk and nutmeg, increase heat to medium-high, and cook, stirring constantly and smashing squash with the back of spoon, until squash is dissolved into the polenta, 10–15 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in Parmesan and 1/4 cup butter until melted. Let cool slightly. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering. Add sage and cook, stirring, just until leaves are lightly crisped and darker in color, about 1 minute. Using a slotted spoon, transfer sage to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Grease a shallow 3-qt. baking dish with butter, then transfer polenta mixture to baking dish. Scatter Fontina cheese over and press down lightly with spoon to submerge. Top with crisped sage. Let cool to room temperature, then cover and chill overnight and up to 2 days. Preheat oven to 375°F. Uncover dish and bake casserole until bubbly and lightly browned on top, 30–35 minutes. Let sit 10 minutes before serving.', 'ANNA STOCKWELL', 'https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/cheesy-baked-butternut-squash-polenta', '3 hours, plus overnight chilling', '10–12 servings');
