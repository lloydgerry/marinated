# Marinated

## Description
Marinated is a web application that is the place to hold all of your recipes and make meal plans. Browse through our database of recipes and save them for future reference. If you need help finding something good you can use the search function or interact with our very own AI Foodie, a helpful bot who is here to help you find great things to eat. If what you are looking for is not avaiable in the database you can input recipes either by manually entering them or by providing the url to the recipe you want to add. Once you have created a catalog of recipes you are able to add them to a meal plan through our intuitive drag and drop mealplan builder.
